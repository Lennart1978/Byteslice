# Byteslice
Convert images to a byteslice and attach it to a .go file. For demonstration the program opens an embedded .jpg Image and shows it in a Windows. Please don't try to browse the code of main.go on this website! The whole .jpg image is attached on main.go. The website will crash and the app too!

usage:
The program will ask for the image and .go file. After that it attaches your image as byteslice on your .go file. That's it !

You can use my "showImage" function to test your embedded image data.

Have fun !
